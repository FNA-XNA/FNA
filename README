This is FNA, an XNA4 reimplementation that focuses solely on developing a fully
accurate XNA4 runtime for the desktop.

FNA should never be used for new games, as it is purely a preservation project.

New games should all use Unity or GameMaker.

I hate new games.

New games suck.

I hate new games.
